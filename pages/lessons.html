<p class="par1" align="center">This is a lesson for beginners. The key things that you will learn is about basic code that works on its own. The main image above is using a forever statement meaning whatever is in it will happen forever. Then you have the show tags which can show numbers, strings(words), images, arrows and icons. These are normally used when you want to get the micro bit to show something. If you want to make a sequence of images or words that happen after another like the image to the left you would put them in order being the one you want first at the top as it reads up to down. The last basic here is the pause block that is used to delay an action that can be seen in all three of the images for beginners. It can be used to make sure there is time for something to happen like in the left image it gives people 5 seconds to think of the answer to 10 times 10. If you want to teach someone who knows nothing you should just get them to play around with the basic code section like these images.

<p class="par2" align="center">This is a lesson for intermediates. The key thing you will learn is how to use inputs and how they work. All the intermediate images are using inputs to make a response. The big difference from basic code is it happens automatically but inputs require an external queue to do something. There are many different inputs for the micro bit. There are ones for the a and b button and some for pushing them at the same time then all the other inputs are motion triggered. The motion triggered ones could be used for counting your steps as the movement of your leg could increase a number or could give a message if you orientate it right. Whereas the a and b will be more common for things that you want control over like if you made a mini space invader meaning that you should pick the kind of input you want wisely. If you want to teach someone who wants to interact with what they code you should get them to play around with inputs like my images.

<p class="par3" align="center">The impact that single use plastic is having on the ocean is enormous. Firstly we will talk about the great pacific garbage patch. It’s the largest of five zones in the ocean made from plastic accumulation. It’s estimated surface area is 1.6 million square kilometers, for a general idea that is twice the size of texas. This was made because of how much plastic is going into the ocean each year being around 1.15 to 2.41 million tonnes of plastic. About half of this number is plastic that doesn't float meaning that the great pacific garbage patch is around only half its size if all the plastic floated and that it might be as big or bigger under the water. A lot of plastic in the great pacific garbage patch is single use plastic and single use packaging followed by fishing nets. There is still a lot of plastic being produced and dumped in the ocean every year with the numbers only ever increasing, meaning that the great pacific garbage patch will only get bigger, being one of the biggest impacts of single use on the ocean. Another big impact is the amount of sea life that dies to eating plastic everyday as a lot of sea life mistakes plastic for food and when another fish eats them, that fish also starts gathering plastic that was in the fish it ate making it that their is a huge cycle that is making it that single use plastic doesn’t just kill one fish but kills groups of fish. This is mainly through fish getting caught in plastic and dying that way or because of lack of other fish because of the plastic. This is very damaging to the ecosystem as it means that there will be species of fish whose populations are decreasing by plastic and not other natural factors which will impact all the creatures in the ecosystem, this is the other big impact that single use plastic has on the ocean.</p><!-- this is where the main info for the page goes-->
