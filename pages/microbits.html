<p class="par1" align="center">Single use plastic is plastic that is designed to only be used once. A lot of people think that putting this plastic in the recycling solves the problem but that is not true as a lot of single use plastic that is put in the recycling bin ends up in the dump or landfill. This is because a lot of single use plastic is not able to be recycled but it may say that it is. This is because a lot of companies say that the plastic they use is recyclable but they only say that so people don’t complain that it's not good for the environment. A lot of the single use plastic that is overused is plastic bags followed by plastic water bottles. This is because plastic bags can’t be reused and are not biodegradable as even when you go to a supermarket and it says that the bags are biodegradable, there are studies that have proven that they are lying as the bags still don’t biodegrade. There are also studies that prove that a majority of companies that use plastic say they will recycle them but in reality, only a small percentage of companies really recycle. This is because humans produce an extreme amount of plastic everyday and the amount of money it would take to recycle it would make any company go bankrupt. Single use plastic never truly degrades as it will slowly get smaller and smaller but it never disappears it just becomes so small that the human eye can’t see it meaning time will not help us get rid of plastic. The second worst single plastic is plastic water bottles as they are mass produced and the majority of people use them. This is bad because studies have shown that a majority of plastic bottles are not recycled and are thrown in the dump or landfill. This is because a lot of plastic bottles are not made with recycled materials and can’t be recycled which is why they are the second worst single use plastic. Lastly there's a lot of single use plastics we aren’t even aware of like wet wipes which are 80% plastic but companies were allowed to not tell us showing that plastic can be in things and we wouldn’t even know it being the final reason single use plastic is so bad.</p><!-- this is where the main info for the page goes-->
