				<p>
					Microbit teaching and learning is a site I made in school to try to help encourage people to use micro bits and to get primary school teachers to want to use micro bits. As I am only a student this site was made and designed by me. I will make sure that all images I didn't  take myself are credited as I want my site to be trustworthy. This site will also have some lessons on coding for micro bits as I want people to be able to learn and teach about micro bits through this site.
